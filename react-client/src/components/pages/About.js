      Iâ€™ve always had an interest in coding and technology, as my father was an
      engineer. However, I never pursued this interest and ended up studying
      economics in school. During that time, I created my own business related
      to the food industry. Delivery applications were practically non-existent
      at the time, which was my primary motivation for creating a late-night
      delivery mobile app based in San Diego. But I soon realized I was unable
      to build this product without technical experience. I had to depend on
      student coders who were interested in creating the application, but had
      limited availability due to attending university. As a result, I was
      forced to abandon this idea. I soon went on to pursue digital marketing,
      which I found very interesting. Yet during that course, my professor
      continually emphasized the importance of web development, leading me to
      begin an online Udemy coding course. Through this course, I came to
      realize that I thoroughly enjoyed coding more than any other subject I had
      studied previously, and I wanted to continue pursuing this career path.
      This was my primary motivation for applying and attending Fullstack, which
      has been an incredible learning experience thus far. In the future I would
      like to explore opportunities in edTech, finTech, and Cloud IT company at
      small to large-sized company. What I am currently doing is creating
      website for a Cloud IT start-up as well as studying for MSCE 50-732,
      50-733, and 50-733 to become certified as Microsoft Cloud Solutions
      Expert.
